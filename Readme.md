# Google Interview Question

Imagine you place a knight chess piece on a phone dial pad. 
This chess piece moves in an uppercase “L” shape: two steps horizontally followed by one vertically, or one step horizontally then two vertically.
Suppose you dial keys on the keypad using only hops a knight can make. 
Every time the knight lands on a key, we dial that key and make another hop. 
The starting position counts as being dialed.
How many distinct numbers can you dial in N hops from a particular starting position?
